# Cougar Automation Reminder Windows Application
This is a Windows application to automate some of the admin work performed by Cougar Automation employees such as:
* Filling in timesheets
* Filling in movements
* Entering overtime

Currently the application has the functionality to:
* Open a popup to enter a timesheet booking on a daily basis at configurable times to fill in your timesheet 
* Store the last 10 timesheet bookings entered and allow you to rebook them
* Open a popup to enter movements for either the current or following week on a weekly basis at a configurable time
* Retrieve overtime bookings and copy to a format that can be pasted into the overtime Excel form.
